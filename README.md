Project Background

This project explores sales performance data for a furniture company, focusing on analyzing key business metrics using Excel. The dataset includes detailed transactional data, customer information, product categories, and geographic sales distribution.

The goal of the analysis is to uncover trends, highlight high and low-performing products, and generate actionable insights to improve sales strategy and profitability. The final output is an interactive Excel dashboard providing stakeholders with an at-a-glance view of core performance metrics.
